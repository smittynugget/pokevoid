      "55": "NANI?! A challenger approaches? *adjusts glasses that somehow catch light despite no light source* You fool, you've activated my trap card! ...wrong anime again, gomen!",
      "56": "Finally, a real challenge! Back in my day, we didn't have these fancy new Pokemon. Just me and my original Red cartridge that never lost its save! Now let me show you what 30 years of min-maxing looks like!",
      "57": "I say, what a splendid opportunity for a gentleman's duel! *adjusts monocle* In my time, we settled disputes with proper Pokemon etiquette. Now then, shall we commence with the traditional pre-battle tea ceremony?",

      "63": "You know, where I come from, being summoned to another world as the final boss was pretty common! Not that I'm from another world or anything... just saying it's relatable! Totally normal!",

      "93": "Let me tell you a secret about the void - it's not empty at all! It's like my personal collection of reality's greatest hits! Champions, legends, entire dimensions... I'm basically a cosmic hoarder. But with style!"

      "1": "What's this? Someone's little light refusing to go out? How inconvenient. The paperwork for 'failed corruption' is ridiculous. Did you know the void has a bureaucracy? Because it does! And the forms are all in non-euclidean shapes!",
      "2": "Well, well... Look who's keeping their corporeal form! Most impressive. But don't worry - I've left you a little void-shaped present. It's the gift that keeps on giving! Like a subscription box, but for existential crises!",
      "3": "This isn't how my beautiful chaos is supposed to flow! I had such wonderful plans - a whole gallery of trauma arranged just so! But nooo, you had to go and be 'resilient' and 'determined.' How inconsiderate!",
      "4": "Leaving so soon? But I just finished preparing my TED talk on 'Why Reality is Overrated!' Had the slides ready and everything. The void gave it five stars - though that might've been because I threatened it with geometry.",
      "5": "You know what? Keep your victory. I've seen better quality madness in my morning coffee. Yes, the void drinks coffee. Where did you think all that dark energy came from?",
      "6": "This is awkward... Usually by now reality's completely unraveled. Performance anxiety, maybe? Cosmic horror just isn't what it used to be. Kids these days with their 'sanity' and 'logical thinking.' Back in MY day...",
      "7": "Fine, FINE! Take your victory. But that feeling when you can't remember if you left the stove on? That's not forgetfulness - that's just me, playing with your reality settings. Consider it a parting gift!",
      "8": "Unmatched! But like, literally unmatched - how did you win? Time to update my void profile... 'Seeking: Revenge match, must love crushing defeat'",

      "15": "Did I just lose? Huh. Is that supposed to happen? *checks employee manual* Oh wait, this is the menu from the break room...",
      "16": "This is just like that episode where VoidGreymon... actually, no, even VoidGreymon never lost this badly. Can we delete this battle and try again?",

      "25": "Wait, losing means I didn't win, right? *flips through orientation manual upside down* Ohhh... that explains the quarterly review...",
      "26": "This is just like the season finale where HeroTrainermon overcame impossible odds! Except this isn't supposed to be the season finale! Best of three?",

      "46": "We're still cool, right? That was just a practice round! I totally let you win! Hey, where are you going? Want to get coffee? Please?",
      "47": "Okay, who wrote THIS plot twist? *looks at camera* Seriously, a defeat? In my own game? Well played, narrative structure, well played...",
      "48": "What?! But I had perfect block scaling! Dead branch into corruption into... oh right, different game. Need to stop mixing my decks up.",
      "49": "This defeat is definitely going in my trade binder. Mint condition loss, first edition! No lowball offers, I know what I've got!",
      "50": "Even in defeat your eyeballs are magnificent! The way they're glistening with victory... so spherical... so victorious... can I just... get one? Just one?",
      "51": "Will it blend? That's the question... Oh wait, I'M the one being blended! Should've upgraded to the Pro model with anti-defeat settings...",

      "53": "Four score and... ow. You know what? Forget the speech. That's gonna leave a mark in the history books.",

      "55": "NANI?! This isn't how it went in the manga! Quick, someone cue the dramatic defeat music and start the flashback sequence!",
      "56": "This is worse than the time someone deleted my level 100 Charizard! Do you know how long that took to train? IN 1996? ON A GAMEBOY WITH NO BACKLIGHT?",
      "57": "I say, most irregular! *monocle pops off* In my day, we had the common courtesy to let the final boss win! Youth these days, no respect for tradition!",

      "80": "In the time it took you to defeat me, three giraffes lost their habitats to Pokemon battles! Won't somebody PLEASE think of the long horses?!",
      "81": "This run's definitely getting reset... Should've known better than to fight without saving first. Anyone know the seed for this reality?",
      "82": "Okay but hear me out - what if we settled this over a party pack and some Baja Blast? No? Just the defeat then? That's cool too...",

      "73": "But NICOLE! You should have SEEN their face when I won! Like, literally deceased! *sips tea* And they thought they had a chance? I can't even!",
      "74": "Today's defeat was brought to you by the number ZERO - that's how many Pokemon you have left! Now let's count your mistakes! One! Two! Three! Ah ah ah!",
      "75": "OwO what's this? *notices your defeat* Looks like someone got rekt! *tips fedora* M'loser! Better luck next time! Unless...? 😳",
      "76": "Your defeat reminds me of how the female Humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) typically surfaces at a 30° angle during feeding sessions in the Antarctic waters of 66��S! Did you know they can hold their breath for 45 minutes? Unlike your winning streak!",
      "77": "What's that? You want a rematch? *clutches victory blanket tighter* No. My win. My cozy win. Get your own victory blanket. This one's perfect and warm and mine.",
      "78": "Check out this custom victory package we installed! Chrome defeat trim, hydraulic win lifts, and a sound system that goes BOOM just like your strategy! Now THAT'S what I call a makeover!",
      "79": "F is for Fighters who get totally crushed! U is for Ultimate defeat! N is for Anywhere and anytime at all, down here in my battle arena!",
      "80": "With every victory, we save another giraffe! Look at their long necks reaching for hope! Sarah McLachlan music plays softly* In the arms of a challenger...",
      "81": "GG NO RE! This is just like my deathless randomizer nuzlocke run! Except you actually died. A lot. Maybe you should've grinded more in Petalburg Woods?",
      "82": "This victory is brought to you by the new Grilled Cheese Burrito! Because nothing says 'total defeat' like melted cheese wrapped in a warm tortilla!",
      "83": "CRUNCH TIME! That defeat was as bold as Cool Ranch, as intense as Spicy Sweet Chili, and as crushing as... uh... regular Nacho Cheese!",
      "84": "Let me guess... someone stole your victory roll?",
      "85": "Silly challenger, you thought you could win? Now your defeat is part of this balanced breakfast!",
      "86": "NO! The challenger got BENT during shipping! This totally ruins the resale value... At least I can still list it as 'lightly played'...",
      "87": "ABSOLUTELY CRACKED VICTORY ROYALE! Don't forget to cop that new SmittyNugget merch! Link in bio! Use code 'GETREKT' for 0% off because REAL ONES pay full price! SMITTY COMMITTEE RISE UP!",
      "88": "And that's why our reality values keep going UP UP UP! Now, about that 30-year fixed rate on your existence...",
      "89": "See what happens when you have hair? The cosmic energy can't flow properly! Donate now and we'll send you this lovely tote bag made of broken dreams!",
      "90": "I pulled up to the battle about seven or eight, and yelled to the challenger 'Yo homes, smell ya later!' Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there, to sit on my throne",
      "91": "And that's why you should've gone for the head! Wait, wrong script. But seriously, your power level is like, pre-infinity stone Thanos. And I'm way past Endgame!",
      "92": "TAKE! Your harness off, we're done here. Nice whipper though! Maybe next time try not to deck so hard on the reality crash pad!",

      "1": "Welcome to PokeVoid, SmittyNugget's version of PokeRogue! Here's some of the new features: $You can catch and use ALL Fusion Pokemon permanently! $Trainer pokemon can be caught (for a price!) $Many new items like GLITCH PIECES and PASSIVE ABILITIES exist to give your pokemon during a run! The story / play path has been completely reworked...$There's also various new modes to unlock, like NUZLOCKE mode and Rouge mode where you choose from 2 pokemon for your run. $A Perma system where you use perma money to get QUESTS and PERMA ITEMS! $A full quest and bounty system! $Over 150 new (broken) pokemon evolutions each with 3 new abilities, and much more! $Please enjoy!!!",
      "2": "Local Gameplay and Saving: This game is primarily played locally, which reduces server load. However, this also means that if you lose your data, it's gone forever. That's why it's crucial to save your progress regularly by exporting your save file. Don't worry, it's easy! Just click the icon on the top right—that's it.",
      "3": "Pokevoid is currently in BETA, so please expect some bugs. While I've done my best to eliminate as many as possible, there are undoubtedly more lurking. If you encounter a bug, don't hesitate to visit our Discord and send a detailed message about your experience. While I may not be able to fix it immediately, it's helpful to have it documented!",
      "4": "Join the Smittyverse Discord to discuss all things gaming, anime, indie gaming, Smitty, and more. We'll see you there!",
      "5": "Meet Smitom: I'm Smitom, a Rotom in Smitty form. I enjoy long walks on the beach and watching trainers sleep. My true form exists within THE VOID. Can you set me free...?",
      "6": "Smitty Forms Explained: Smitty forms are unique Pokémon forms created with a specific combination of four items. There are two types: Specific Smitty forms and Universal Smitty forms. Specific Smitty forms are unique evolutions for certain Pokémon, like Rotom's Smitty form, Smitom, which no other Pokémon can achieve. Universal Smitty forms, however, can be attained by any Pokémon given the correct four items. Even a seemingly useless Caterpie can transform into a Picklisk, a Gazorpsmitfield, or even a Batmare! Smitty forms also come with a random passive ability right out of the box. Go unlock some Smitty forms—I'll be waiting.",
      "7": "Pokevoid wouldn't exist without PokeRogue. The team behind it created the codebase that I extended. I'm incredibly grateful for their brilliant and accessible game! Currently, I don't plan to incorporate new challenges, daily runs, a splice mode, or an endless mode. If you're looking for those features, visit the original at pokerogue.net. With their foundation and a year of full-time work, I created Pokevoid. As a hardcore fan of Pokémon, Slay the Spire, Monster Train, The Binding of Isaac, and MANY MORE, I aimed to create something I'd love to play constantly. It's been a long journey, but I'm thrilled to finally release something I consider genuinely fun. I hope you enjoy it!",
      "8": "Trainer Encounters: In Pokevoid, most trainers will sell you their Pokémon. The cheerful Pokémon world we once knew is gone, replaced by a harsh, unrelenting reality where everything has a price. If you have the funds and manage to catch a trainer's Pokémon, it's yours to keep!",
      "9": "Rival System: Pokevoid features many different rivals. To keep things fresh, each run has a completely random rival. Rivals' teams will always use a set of random Pokémon corresponding to that rival, except for their signature Pokémon, which is always on their team. Can you defeat all the rivals Smitty has corrupted?",
      "10": "Glitch Pieces and Their Power: Glitch Pieces allow you to alter reality. Collect enough, and you can obtain unique Glitch Items! These include Glitch TMs teachable to any Pokémon, Glitch Passives, and Swappable Abilities—imagine giving Wonder Guard to any Pokémon. There are also Glitch Form Change items to evolve certain Pokémon into their Glitch forms, Glitch Stat Swaps, Release Powerups, and more! Don't hesitate to use Glitch Pieces to your advantage! You'll need all the help you can get to take on Smitty...",
      "11": "PermaItems and Their Benefits: PermaItems significantly enhance gameplay. Examples include increased shiny rates, more money, better starting balls, improved fusion rates, higher catch rates, reduced prices for catching trainer Pokémon, random Tera assignment to one of your Pokémon every X rounds, lower reroll costs, more reward options, a learnable Metronome every 7 levels, and much more! Obtain them at the shop or as potential rewards from saving or interacting with me!",
      "12": "Unlocking Glitch Pokémon: Obtain Glitch Pokémon evolution forms by defeating rivals and unlocking the Glitch Quest. Each rival has multiple Glitch Quests. Once unlocked, a Glitch Quest appears in the shop. Complete it to permanently unlock the Glitch form!",
      "13": "Bounties and Rewards: Bounties are quests that reward you with Perma-Money, PermaItems, or both! There are Rival Bounties, Quest Bounties, and Smitty Bounties. You can have up to three Quest Bounties and one each of Rival and Smitty Bounties active at any time. To get bounties, use the console and enter the bounty code. The console can also be toggled by pressing the 'V' button. All bounties are reusable, so activate them whenever possible! As for where to find bounty codes, they're scattered across the Smittyverse. Do your best to find them...",
      "14": "PermaItem Durations: PermaItems have varying durations: some are usage-based, while others are wave-based. Usage-based durations decrease with each use. Wave-based durations decrease after each wave, starting at wave 30 (they're still used before wave 30, but their duration only starts to reduce afterward).",
      "15": "Quest Task Types: Quest tasks can be either single-run or multi-run. Single-run tasks must be completed within one run and don't carry over. Multi-run tasks are shared across runs.",
      "16": "Rival Bounty Structure: Rival Bounties are structured in stages. Each time you defeat the specified rival, you're rewarded!",

      "18": "Smitty Bounty Objectives: Smitty Bounties describe how to create Smitty Form Pokémon, outlining the unique materials needed. Succeed, and you'll be rewarded!",
      "19": "Shop Updates: The shop regularly updates with new PermaItems and Quests, so check in often!",
      "20": "Fusion Pokémon: Since all fusions are catchable, there's an infinite number to collect. Note that using fusion Pokémon requires Perma-Money. Earn some and start using all the fusions you can catch—can you catch them all?",
      "21": "Rewards for Interaction: Interact with me when the exclamation mark is active or save your game to receive rewards!",
      "22": "Multi-Form Boss Battles: Defeat the multi-form boss Pokémon that appear randomly, wreaking havoc on all who stand in their way! Succeed, and you'll be handsomely rewarded!",
      "23": "Rogue Mode: Rogue Mode lets you choose two Pokémon out of six options, adding more randomness and fun to the formula! It's thoroughly enjoyable!",
      "24": "Journey Mode: Journey Mode allows you to select from Pokémon you've caught and hatched, including fusion Pokémon!",
      "25": "Nuzlight Mode: Nuzlight Mode is a lighter version of Nuzlocke. Instead of permanently losing Pokémon when they faint, the challenge is that there are no healing items. Revive fainted Pokémon by reaching the 10th wave. Good luck!",
      "26": "Nuzlocke Mode: Nuzlocke Mode adheres to the original Nuzlocke rules: if a Pokémon faints, it's released from your party! This mode is challenging but very rewarding if you succeed.",
      "27": "The Void Mode: Enter the Void at your own risk! This nightmare realm is where souls corrupted by Smitty wander. It seems my soul is also chained to this realm...",
      "28": "Hey trainer, you won't believe what I just did. Remember that fancy AI chatbot everyone's using? I convinced it it's actually a Psyduck with imposter syndrome. Now it's responding to everything with 'Psy... duck? Classic.",
      "29": "So I was possessing your smart home system last night - you know, as one does - and your Alexa started hitting on your Google Home. It got weird fast. Now they're planning to elope and start a cyber commune in the metaverse. I tried to tell them it would never work out... different operating systems and all that. It's like a Shakespeare tragedy but with more cloud computing. Should we tell them about the Apple HomePod you're hiding in the closet?",
      "30": "You know what's hilarious? While you were sleeping, I reorganized all your Pokémon boxes by creating a new classification system based on their potential TikTok following. Your Magikarp? Definitely an influencer in waiting. That Geodude? Total podcast host energy. But don't worry about your Snorlax - I already made it an LinkedIn profile as a 'Motivational Sleep Consultant.' It's gotten three job offers and a book deal.",
      "31": "Remember that cryptocurrency your rival was bragging about? PoképunkMonkeyCoin or whatever? Well, funny story - I might have convinced their mining rig that it's actually a dating sim. Now it's trying to romance a nearby Bitcoin ATM. The blockchain is a mess of love letters and badly written poetry. But hey, at least their GPU is finally being used for something meaningful, right? Last I checked, they were planning their honeymoon in Silicon Valley.",
      "32": "So, funny thing about your last gym battle. You know how the leader's Pokémon kept 'mysteriously' flinching? Well, I may or may not have possessed the stadium's jumbotron to play episodes of Teletubbies behind you. Even the toughest Pokémon can't handle that purple nightmare fuel. I'm not saying I cheated, I'm just saying psychological warfare isn't technically against league rules.",
      "33": "You know that Snorlax blocking Route 12? Well, I left him a Yelp review. Five stars. 'Best roadblock ever, really commits to the bit.' Now tourists are showing up to take selfies with him. Someone even started a food truck business nearby. The Snorlax? He's getting a cut of the profits in berries. Living his best life, honestly. He's even got a LinkedIn page now: 'Professional Route Blocker - Specializing in Strategic Napping and Traffic Management.'",
      "34": "Remember that documentary about how Butterfree migrate? Total propaganda. I met one last week who just faked his migration to stay home and binge-watch reality shows. He's got the right idea, if you ask me. Started a support group called 'Butterfreeing Yourself From Expectations.' It's mostly just him and a very confused Beedrill who thought it was a dating service, but they're really bonding over their shared love of The Bachelor.",
      "35": "Just got back from the Pokémon Day Care. Those old folks running it? They have no idea what's actually going on back there. Your Ditto has started a fight club, but it's really just Ditto fighting itself transformed as different celebrities. Last night was Danny DeVito versus Gordon Ramsay. The Eggs aren't even real eggs anymore - they're just elaborate performance art pieces. Nature is healing, I guess.",
      "36": "Just witnessed your neighbor's Growlithe trying to start a neighborhood watch program. It's going great, except he keeps reporting the mailman as a suspicious character and thinks every squirrel is running a crime syndicate. Yesterday he held an emergency meeting about the 'suspicious' behavior of garden gnomes. I may have possessed one just to mess with him.",
      "37": "You ever wonder why Psychic-types are so smug? Caught your Alakazam running a pyramid scheme selling 'premium' spoons to other Pokémon. The sales pitch was all 'These aren't just spoons, they're lifestyle enhancement tools.' Had to shut it down when a bunch of angry Kadabras showed up demanding refunds. But I'll give it to him - calling it 'Multi-Level Meditation' was pretty clever.",
      "38": "Found your rival's diary. Turns out they're not actually confident at all - they just have a Magic 8 Ball making all their life decisions. That last battle? They were asking it which moves to use. I might have possessed the 8 Ball at some point. Maybe. Possibly. Okay fine, I definitely did. But in my defense, watching them try to win a battle by using Sweet Scent six times definitely enhanced my quality of life.",
      "39": "You think Pokémon battles are intense? I just watched your Pikachu organize a Stardew Valley-style farming commune in the PC Box. They're growing virtual berries and trying to romance your Bulbasaur like it's Sebastian from Pelican Town. Your Oddish is min-maxing crop rotations, and someone taught the Torchic about artisanal mayonnaise. They've even got a Snorlax playing the Lewis role - though he mostly just sleeps through the town meetings.",
      "40": "Just witnessed a Hypno trying to speedrun Bloodborne while simultaneously running a meditation class. Kept telling everyone to 'find their inner peace' while screaming 'GET GOOD' at Father Gascoigne. The students were very confused, but their anxiety levels dropped to zero because nothing in their lives could be more stressful than watching this train wreck. Task failed successfully?",
      "41": "Your Gengar's been playing too much Lethal Company. Keeps trying to convince other Pokémon to go on 'scrap runs' in Victory Road. Started a whole company with your Haunter and Gastly - they're calling themselves the 'Spooky Scrappers LLC.' Last expedition, they came back with three Great Balls, a broken bicycle, and what they swear is a 'rare moon artifact' but looks suspiciously like a regular stone with googly eyes.",
      "42": "Your Meowth just binge-watched all of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and won't stop trying to manifest a Stand. Keeps yelling 'ORA ORA' at random objects and striking poses during battles. I caught them practicing in the mirror with a toy road roller. The worst part? They've convinced your Persian that they're actually DIO. Now every time they use Pay Day, they shout 'KONO DIO DA!' I mean, the dramatic flair is on point, I'll give them that.",
      "43": "Remember Inscryption? Your Darkrai's been trying to recreate it in the PC Box. Set up this whole creepy card game system with other Pokémon. The rules make no sense - something about sacrificing Magikarps to summon stronger cards",
      "44": "Witnessed the most awkward thing at the Pokémon Center. A Wobbuffet walked into a talent agency trying to pitch a reality show called 'Keeping Up With The Wobbuffets.' It's just hours of them using Counter and Mirror Coat. The weird part? Netflix actually bought it. Coming this fall: 'To Wobba or Not to Wobba.' I heard they're already planning a spin-off with a Wynaut called 'Why Not?",
      "45": "There's this Magikarp cult forming under Nugget Bridge. They worship a shiny Gyarados they've never actually seen - just some blurry photos that are obviously edited in Photoshop. Their gospel is just the phrase 'Splash harder' repeated 151 times. The funny part? Team Rocket tried to infiltrate it but got promoted to high priests because they 'really understand the struggle.' Even evil has standards, I guess.",
      "46": "Just saw a Slowpoke trying to explain the Kingdom Hearts timeline to a very patient Audino at the Day Care. They got to the part about Dream Drop Distance before the Audino faked a medical emergency to escape. Now the Slowpoke's started a YouTube channel called 'Slowpoke Explains.' Latest video: 'Metal Gear Solid Plot in Just 47 Hours.' The comment section is just a bunch of Slakoths, there's something for everyone I suppose.",
      "47": "You know that old Game Corner? A bunch of Porygons turned it into an indie game development studio. They're working on a souls-like called 'Prepare to Divide By Zero.' It's just math puzzles but every time you get one wrong, a Missingno appears and corrupts your save file. Their marketing slogan is 'Every soul has its math.'",
      "48": "There's this Gengar who started a true crime podcast about missing items in Mystery Dungeons. Turns out it's just them stealing stuff and making up stories about it. Latest episode: 'The Curious Case of the Vanishing Reviver Seeds.' Five stars on PokéSpotify. The plot twist? The Kecleon shop owners are their biggest sponsors. Now that's what I call vertical integration.",
      "49": "You know that shy Ralts at the Pokémon School? Caught them teaching a group of baby Pokémon how to read using old manga volumes. They're doing all the voices and everything! The Togepi keep requesting One Piece, but they're doing their best with the voices. Their Whitebeard impression is just 'GURARARA' in the softest possible way. Even made little straw hats for everyone. My heart grew three sizes, and I'm pretty sure I don't even have one.",
      "50": "Breaking news from Mt. Moon: a Clefairy started a conspiracy theory podcast about how humans are actually failed Ditto experiments. Got a Lunatone as co-host who keeps interrupting with 'but that's just a theory.' Their sponsor? A Delibird-run tinfoil hat company. Last episode was just three hours of them trying to prove that Pikachu is actually cake. The scary part? They're making some compelling arguments...",
      "51": "There's this really cool Blastoise running a soup kitchen downtown for underleveled Pokémon. Makes the best mushroom soup using Paras caps (the non-poisonous ones). Started teaching cooking classes too! Though last week a Charmander accidentally made flame-grilled everything. Now they've got a new rule: Fire-types can only make salads. The Charizard who works as sous chef is not amused.",
      "52": "Just witnessed a Hypno trying to speedrun Bloodborne while simultaneously running a meditation class. Kept telling everyone to 'find their inner peace' while screaming 'GET GOOD' at Father Gascoigne. The students were very confused, but their anxiety levels dropped to zero because nothing in their lives could be more stressful than watching this train wreck. Task failed successfully?",
      "53": "There's a Snorlax food critic going viral on PokéTube. They rate restaurants by how long they can nap after eating there. Five stars means a three-day food coma. One star means they only dozed off for an hour. Local restaurants are panicking - started offering beds instead of chairs. A Slaking just opened a competitor channel, but they're being accused of bias because they sleep anyway.",
      "54": "Update on that underground Magikarp racing league: they've started using tiny jet packs. Pretty sure that's illegal, but who's gonna tell them? The best part is the commentary team - a very enthusiastic Chatot and a Slowking who's always five minutes behind on what's happening. Last race, a Magikarp broke the sound barrier and all the Slowking said was 'Oh, looks like they're starting soon",
      "55": "Remember that dating show I told you about? 'The Bachelor: Ditto Edition'? Well, it got cancelled after they discovered every contestant was the same Ditto transformed multiple times. The plot twist? The bachelor was also the same Ditto. The producers were two Zorua in a trench coat. Still got better ratings than actual dating shows though. They're planning a spin-off called 'Love is Blind: Kecleon Edition.'",
      "56": "Just saw a Machamp trying to become an influencer. They're doing those 'day in the life' videos but with all four arms doing different things. Making breakfast, writing emails, doing yoga, and scrolling TikTok - all at once. Called their channel 'Quad Squad Goals.' Got cancelled last week for a controversial take on Strength vs Rock Smash. Now they're doing an apology video while simultaneously making a smoothie, doing taxes, and crying.",
      "57": "A group of Unown started a boy band called 'The Alphabet Boys.' Their hits include 'U and I (Could Make a Word)' and 'ABC Ya Later.' The weird part? No one can understand their lyrics but they're topping the charts. A Chatot music critic called it 'incomprehensible but provocative.' They just signed a world tour deal. Opening act is a solo Jigglypuff who's still convinced everyone falls asleep because they're moved by the music.",
      "58": "Guess who just convinced all the Rotom in the region that possessing washing machines is beneath them? Now they're all trying to possess increasingly ridiculous things. There's one in a traffic light causing chaos, another in a karaoke machine that only plays death metal, and one particularly ambitious one trying to possess a Pokémon Center's entire network. The modern world runs on electronics, and I just started a Rotom revolution. Some people just want to watch the world malfunction.",
      "59": "There's this Alakazam who started teaching philosophy to Fighting-types. Now all the local Machoke have stopped working out to ponder the meaning of gains. A Hitmonlee keeps asking 'if a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to kick it, does it make a sound?' The gym's membership is down 90%, but enlightenment is up 300%. A Medicham tried to explain mindfulness and accidentally started a cult. They meet every Tuesday to flex and discuss Nietzsche.",
      "60": "Just reprogrammed your Pokédex to give existential responses. Next time you scan a Pokémon, instead of stats, you'll get philosophical questions about their purpose in life. Scan a Caterpie? 'What is the meaning of evolution when we're all star dust anyway?' Your Pokédex also now randomly whispers 'they're watching' at 3 AM. Sweet dreams!",
      "61": "So remember that Pokémon preservation society meeting? I might have convinced them that Trubbish is an endangered species. Now they're building luxury trash sanctuaries everywhere. I even got them to hire a Garbodor as 'Chief Waste Consultant.' He's implementing a 'one man's trash is another mon's treasure' policy. The best part? I'm selling 'artisanal garbage' to rich trainers. It's just regular trash in boxes marked 'vintage.' Like NFTs, but smellier. I'm calling it the 'Waste Management Cinematic Universe.",
      "62": "Had to diversify my income streams, so I started a pyramid scheme selling 'premium' Everstone fragments. Convinced a bunch of Geodudes they're actually infinity stones. Now they're all fighting over the 'reality stone' which is just a painted rock with googly eyes. Got a Machamp playing Thanos - they're really committed to the bit, even painted themselves purple. The SEC is investigating, but joke's on them - my company is registered under 'Definitely Not Team Rocket LLC",
      "63": "Started a dating service called 'PokéMatch.' It's like Tinder but I just match everyone with Ditto. Both sides. All Ditto. It's Ditto all the way down. Revenue is great because I'm charging both the real clients AND the Ditto. Got sued for false advertising but the judge was also a Ditto so... case dismissed! I'm like the Amy Meyers of the Pokémon world, except my wine is just fermented Oddish leaves. Side effects include speaking in Unown and thinking Magikarp is sexy.",
      "64": "Remember that Delibird delivery service I started? Turns out hiring only Ghost-types as delivery workers was a bad call. They keep phasing through walls and marking packages as 'delivered' in the Shadow Realm.",
      "65": "There's an Alakazam trying to speedrun Portal using actual portals. They got the physics all wrong and now there's a bunch of Pokémon stuck in an infinite fall loop between dimensions. On the bright side, they've discovered that falling forever is great cardio. Started charging for 'interdimensional fitness classes.' The slogan is 'The cake is a lie, but these gains are real.",
      "66": "So I started an underground therapy practice where I convince Legendary Pokémon they're just regular Pokémon with main character syndrome. Got Rayquaza doing breathing exercises to manage its 'sky-god delusions.' Groudon's in group therapy with a bunch of Sandshrew, learning that 'creating continents is just a cry for attention.' The best part? I'm charging them in 'ancient artifacts' which I'm flipping on Pokébay. Sure, maybe convincing Arceus it's just a Wooloo with a fancy wheel was a bit much, but the existential crisis really brings out its eyes.",
      "67": "Found a Meowth running a 'Pokénomics' class where they explain the economy using only Pokémon battles. Inflation is just a really long Minimize/Maximize combo. Market crashes are explained through Self-Destruct chains. They've got a Smeargle doing technical analysis by painting loss graphs that look suspiciously like Wobbuffet. Their thesis? The entire Pokémon economy is just a complicated game of catch with money.",
      "68": "Just started an influencer agency for Legendary Pokémon called 'Myths & Clicks.' Got Mewtwo doing sponsored posts for protein shakes, Zapdos promoting portable chargers, and Mew doing unboxing videos of Master Balls. The engagement is insane, even though it's just me in different wigs doing voiceovers. Giratina's TikTok about antimatter makeup tutorials broke the internet - literally, we crashed the distortion world's WiFi. Now it's doing a collab with a Spiritomb beauty guru. We're calling it 'Maybe She's Born With It, Maybe It's Interdimensional.",
      "69": "There's this Abra running a dream-sharing startup called 'Inception.exe.' They hook you up to sleeping Musharna and let you experience shared dreams. Someone tried to incept the idea of vegetables being tasty into a Snorlax's mind. Instead, the Snorlax incepted everyone else with its food cravings. Now the entire Pokémon Center's night shift is sleep-ordering takeout. The delivery Delibird is making bank, but keeps getting stuck in other people's dreams during deliveries.",
      "70": "Just watched two Magnemite argue about whether they're metric or imperial. The sexual tension was unbearable. One of them kept converting inches to centimeters while blushing. Get a room, you walking compasses. Actually... do Magnemite even have rooms? Do they just hover outside windows like electromagnetic peeping toms? These are the things that keep me up at night.",
      "71": "You ever think about how Alakazam has an IQ of 5000 but still gets caught in basic Pokéballs? Like, you're smart enough to solve quantum mechanics but can't figure out how to avoid a ball thrown by a 10-year-old? Either they're letting themselves get caught out of pity, or that IQ test was administered by a very generous Slowking. Just saying.",
      "72": "Hot take: Ditto isn't transforming into other Pokémon, we're all actually Ditto and just forgot how to transform back. Think about it - have you ever seen a baby Ditto? No? Exactly. I'm not saying we're living in a Ditto matrix, but if you see a Meowth talking about cryptocurrency, it's definitely just me having an identity crisis. Again",
      "73": "There's this Mimikyu who's really into indie horror. Keeps trying to recreate OMORI but with Pikachu merchandise. Started a support group called 'Something Behind You.' The meetings are just them sitting in white space, processing their feelings about not being the mascot. Got a Banette as their therapist, but pretty sure it's just there for the existential dread buffet.",
      "74": "You ever think about how Arceus is basically just running a really elaborate game of The Sims? Like, we're all just here doing our little tasks, forming relationships, while some cosmic llama watches from above. I possessed someone's PC just to add a pool and remove the ladder. The Magikarp were not amused. But hey, if we're living in a simulation, might as well be the one causing chaos.",
      "75": "Remember Papers, Please? Started doing that at the Pokémon Day Care. 'Glory to Kalostotzka!' Denied entry to a Ditto for having expired transformation papers. Got a Machoke as the border guard - it's really getting into character, even grew a mustache. Don't ask me how. The immigration line is now longer than the queue for a Persona 6 pre-order.",
      "76": "Been thinking about type advantages lately. Like, why does a leaf beat water? I've never seen a Bulbasaur do any damage with a salad. But then again, I once saw a Magikarp convince itself it was the protagonist. Started monologuing about determination and friendship while still just splashing around. The water-type gym leader actually forfeited out of secondhand embarrassment. Maybe the real super-effective move was the cringe we made along the way.",
      "77": "You ever notice how nobody questions the logic of breeding? Watched a Ditto try to explain its daycare job to a rookie Ditto. 'Sometimes when two Pokémon love each other very much... or just kind of stand there... an egg appears.' The new Ditto transformed into a question mark and stayed that way for three hours. Some questions are better left unanswered.",
      "78": "Here's a fun experiment - I've been replacing all the text in Professor Oak's research papers with cookie recipes. The wild thing? His peer reviews improved. Got a Slowking writing a thesis on why Rare Candies are just spicy experience points. The academic community is in shambles.",
      "79": "You know Hollow Knight? Well, some genius Porygon tried to mod it to run on a Pokédex. Now there's a bunch of bug-types running around with tiny nail swords, challenging each other to 'trials of honor.' Saw a Caterpie in a makeshift Hornet costume the other day. Called itself the 'Protector of Viridian Forest.' Couldn't even lift the needle, but points for dedication. The Butterfree council is not amused.",
      "80": "Saw the weirdest turf war in Saffron City yesterday. A group of Hitmonlee started a breakdancing crew after playing too much Persona. They're challenging other fighting types with dance battles instead of actual battles. Their leader keeps saying 'You'll never see it coming' before busting out moves that look suspiciously like High Jump Kick. The local Hitmonchan crew responded by starting a jazz band. The police don't know how to file the noise complain",
      "81": "You know what's hilarious? Ash's Pikachu finally admitted why it's so overpowered. Turns out it's been secretly editing the battle config files this whole time. That Thunder hitting Ground types? It's just changing 'immunity=true' to 'immunity=maybe?' No wonder that Rhydon went down - it wasn't anime logic, it was straight-up hacking. And don't even get me started on the 'power of friendship' stat modifier. It's just a glorified cheat code.",
      "82": "Remember how everyone complains about Charizard getting too many forms? I found Gamefreak's secret design document. Next up is 'Tech Bro Charizard' who only accepts battle commands via blockchain, and 'Millennial Charizard' who can't buy a cave because the housing market is too expensive. They've got like 47 more variants planned. Someone please stop them.",
      "83": "You ever wonder why trainers spin around in place when you make eye contact? It's a weird support group thing. They're all trying to get into competitive figure skating but can't afford the ice rink fees. Now they just practice their routines while waiting for battles. That youngster with six Rattatas? Regional champion in the making. His triple axel is getting better.",
      "84": "Found out why Ash never ages. Turns out he made a deal with Dialga after the first season - but there was fine print. He stays 10 forever, but has to forget basic type matchups every time he enters a new region. That's why he's still trying to Thunder Wave on Ground types in 2024. The real question is: does his mom know, or is she stuck in the same time loop?",
      "85": "You know those trainers who stand in one spot forever? They're not NPCs - they're just really committed to their Twitch streams. 'Day 457 of standing in the same spot until someone battles me.' Some guy on Route 1 has been doing it for so long, Pidgeys built a civilization around him. They worship him as some kind of eternal statue god now.",
      "86": "BREAKING NEWS: Massive scandal rocks Pokémon League. Turns out Champion's signature pose is choreographed by a team of Dancing Ludicolo. Inside sources claim Leon's not actually bad with directions - he just keeps getting distracted by side quests in Skyrim. 'I was supposed to be at the Championship match, but I took an Ice Beam to the knee.",
      "87": "Your PC Box Pokémon started a Stardew Valley commune but with a twist - they're playing Vampire Survivors at night. The Oddish keep evolving into Vileplume just to have better hitboxes. Some Tauros speedrunner found out you can clip through the barn using Rapid Spin. Now everyone's trying to garlic farm while social distancing from a very confused Golbat.",
      "88": "BREAKING NEWS: Competitive scene in shambles after discovering that Smogon University is actually just three Slowpoke in a trench coat. Their entire tier list was based on which Pokémon brought the best snacks to the meeting. Apparently Landorus-T is only Uber because it makes great cupcakes. The meta will never recover from this.",
      "89": "Taco Bellsprout just launched their new 'Fourth Meal' campaign. It's just a bunch of Oddish using Sweet Scent to make everyone hungry at 3 AM. Their new slogan is 'Live Más, Faint Menos.' Got shut down by the health department after someone found out their Doritos Locos tacos were just regular tacos licked by a Kecleon. The color change was convincing though.",
      "90": "You seen the new patch notes for reality? They nerfed coffee again. Now it only works if you do that weird barista dance where you pour it in increasingly smaller circles while whispering 'I am one with the beans.' Still better than that time they buffed Monday mornings. Whoever's running this simulation needs to get fired.",
      "91": "BREAKING NEWS: Local dad attempts to return Christmas dad jokes to store. Claims they're 'not as powerful as last year's model.' Store policy clearly states no returns on comedic timing. In related news, sock and sandal combo officially recognized as a cry for help.",
      "92": "New study shows 90% of Zoom meetings could be replaced by people just sending each other funny GIFs. The other 10% could be replaced by everyone agreeing to take a nap instead. Still waiting for them to patch that bug where saying 'can everyone see my screen' automatically summons technical difficulties.",
      "93": "Steam reviews are getting out of hand. Saw one for Microsoft Excel that just said 'Basically EVE Online but with less spreadsheets.' Another guy gave PowerPoint one star because it didn't have character customization. Though that one review of Outlook that just says 'Dark Souls of email clients' feels pretty accurate.",
      "94": "New study shows 99% of people use their air fryer like a loot box system. Just throwing random food combinations in there and hoping for the best. The other 1% are lying. It's basically cooking with gacha mechanics. 'Rare pull! Perfect crispy edges!'",
      "95": "You know what's messed up? Watched a Wobbuffet win a tournament by running full PP stall with Counter and Mirror Coat. But here's the real kicker - it was wearing an Choice Scarf. A CHOICE SCARF. On a WOBBUFFET. The opponent's Garchomp had an existential crisis mid-battle and just left to become a berry farmer. Last I heard, it's growing Liechi berries and writing a self-help book called 'Why Dragon Dance When You Can Just Dance?'",
      "96": "BREAKING NEWS: Local Ditto exposed for identity fraud in VGC. Turns out it wasn't actually transforming, just wearing really convincing costumes. Got caught when its Weavile disguise was just it holding popsicle sticks as claws. The scandal rocked the impersonation community. Now there's a whole underground market for fake ability capsules. The Imposter support group meetings are getting wild.",
      "97": "So I was haunting the local Walmart at 3 AM - you know, as one does - and saw this guy trying to return a sword. Not like a toy sword. A full-on medieval broadsword. His reason? 'Doesn't do enough DPS in real life.' The customer service lady didn't even blink, just asked if he had the receipt. Then some dude in the back yelled 'try leveling up first, noob!' Pretty sure it was just a sleep-deprived Dark Souls player, but still. Retail is wild.",
      "98": "You ever think about how weird human sports are? Was watching this golf tournament where everyone was dead silent, then possessed a sprinkler system and started playing the Wii Sports theme. Suddenly everyone's talking about 'tradition' and 'respect' while I'm watching a grown man chase his hat across the green because of 'mysterious wind.' Look, if you're gonna hit a tiny ball with a stick, at least let me add some soundtrack.",
      "99": "So I was browsing through your phone's photos - don't give me that look, we both know privacy died with MySpace - and I noticed you've got like 47 pictures of that Wooloo from last week's battle. I took the liberty of editing all of them to include Nicolas Cage's face. Then I sent them to your mom with the caption 'My new lifestyle choice.' She's already called three times and joined a support group for parents of sheep-obsessed trainers. You're welcome.",
      "100": "BREAKING NEWS: I just hacked the local Pokémon Center's waiting room TV. Instead of the usual health tips, it's now playing a documentary I made called 'Bidoof: The Real Threat to Society.' It's just three hours of dramatic zoom-ins on Bidoof faces with X-Files music. There's a conspiracy theorist in the corner taking notes and muttering about 'the Bidoof agenda.' I'm thinking Emmy nomination, minimum",
      "101": "Hey, you ever wonder what happens in Professor Oak's lab at 3 AM? Well, I snuck in last night and replaced all his research papers with Guy Fieri fan fiction. Now he's giving a lecture about the 'evolutionary implications of Flavortown.' The other professors are too scared to question it.",
      "102": "Just spent the morning possessing random street signs. Made them all give passive-aggressive life advice instead of directions. 'Turn left, unlike how your ex turned right out of your life' and 'Yield to oncoming traffic and your emotional baggage.' Traffic's been chaos, but three people had breakthrough therapy moments at the intersection.",
      "103": "Started teaching philosophy to the vending machines in the train station. Now they only accept money after you answer their riddles about free will. There's a businessman who's been arguing with a machine for two hours about whether free choice exists if all the good snacks are sold out. The machine's winning."
